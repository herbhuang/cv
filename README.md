# Academic CV

This repo contains [Geoff Boeing](https://geoffboeing.com/)'s LaTeX academic CV (view [PDF](https://geoffboeing.com/share/cv-gboeing.pdf)), permissively licensed for others to adapt.

The CV content and formatting follow academic standards and emphasize clear information presentation and typography. The CV's TeX file is automatically compiled to PDF and published whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, via this [workflow](https://github.com/gboeing/cv/blob/main/.github/workflows/build_publish.yml). This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file.
